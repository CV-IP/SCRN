3. Train/Test
    * Train
        * Set your dataset path in train_SCRN.py and run it. 
    * Test
        * Download the pre-trained model from [google drive](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1PkGX9R-uTYpWBKX0lZRkE2qvvpz1-IiG) and put it in './model/'. Then set your dataset path in test_SCRN.py and run it.
        * The pre-computed saliency maps can also download fron [google drive](https://drive.google.com/open?id=16nIFpcts43bmZdr9YxPT5x71f1cee6Of)
